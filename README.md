### Hi there üëã

### About me

* Hi, welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a software developer whose passion lies in creating immersive programs in 3D. 
* Every commit to my repositories is a step towards creating virtual worlds that are filled with interesting and unique visual solutions.

* My 3D projects are my experiments with visual art as well as my research in computer graphics. Here you will find my work that brings ideas and concepts to life in 3D space.

* My passion for music is another aspect of my personality. I love music, especially when guitar chords sound, filling the air with melody and emotion. Electronic music also holds 
  a special place in my heart, and its rhythms often inspire me to create new projects.

* In my free time, I also try to expand my creative horizons through drawing. Although my drawings may not always turn out perfectly, I try to express my thoughts and ideas on canvas, 
  and this brings me pleasure.

* Besides developing 3D programs, I am also passionate about creating supporting libraries and tools.

* Join my projects and let's explore the world of 3D programming together!
